#We Use ARIMA Model
The ARIMA model (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a statistical method used for time series analysis and forecasting. It combines three components:
AutoRegressive (AR): Captures the relationship between a value and its past values.
Integrated (I): Accounts for differences to make the time series stationary (removes trends).
Moving Average (MA): Models the relationship between a value and past forecast errors.
